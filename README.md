# SENG-300-Project
Hospital Managment System
Project Description:
  Correct schedule and appointment conflicts as well as add new functionality to the previous system.
The software will allow admins to assign appointments between doctors and patients. 
The system generates a personal file for each patient, assign unique ID’s to the patients, categorize them as in-patients or out-patients, patient notes, contact information, patient status updates when in the hospital from check in, check out, waiting and in-session.
  The system will be able to handle time conflicts of conflicting doctor schedules
Hospital staff will be categorized by department,i.e, as general practitioners or specialized practitioners.
In addition admins will also be able to make schedules for doctors and nurses. Doctors and nurses will also be able to view their own schedules for the next 2-3 months. 
The software should be able to keep track of appointment check in and check out times. This information will be updated bi-weekly/monthly and will be stored up to a year. 
Doctors and patients can also cancel appointments. Upon cancellation or rescheduling both participating doctor and patient will be notified through email. 
  Doctors may also refer patients to another doctor/department if necessary, admins will be notified and reschedule an appointment with the patient and the new doctor. 
Doctors can also schedule group appointments for families, etc..
The system will also remind patients of appointments. Priority scheduling of patients based on their needs.
Only admins have access to all schedules. 
The system will preferably be web based in later implementations but will be initially deployed as a console based software. The new software will be user friendly. 
  Our platform will target doctors, nurses, patients and other hospital staff. 
We will have a database to store our patient, doctor and management data. 
A login interface will allow privacy of data, any communication regarding medication, appointments, test results and patient reports will only be available to the corresponding patient and doctor(s). 
A critical process would be collecting patients‘ information, Diagnosis details, handling anything that was done manually. 
Having a database would allow efficient retrieval of data simultaneously, updates will be effective immediately and maintenance of accumulated patient information. 
  The stored data will allow doctors to effectively diagnose patients cross referencing patients past health record.
Medical supplies quantities and equipment quantities will also be stored in the database to ensure the hospital has sufficient supplies.

Team Goals:
Our goals for this project are too further our understanding and technical skills in software engineering. And to learn new skills in web based development and database management. We also hope that we can meet our customer’s expectations and work effectively as a team in a work based environment. We also hope to develop a system that may be used in a business based environment.  

Team Roles:
Leads will be assigned as follows:-
Yushea Raza, 			User Interface Expert 
Mila Hoogstraat, 			Team Lead
Nandakumar Panneerselvam, 	Code Reviewer,
Nielson Trung, 			Scrum Master
Dominic Nguyen ,			Technical Writer
Roles will also be rotated occasionally allowing team members to learn about the different roles and skills required for developing software. Team meetings will be held before/after lectures depending on members convenience or any other time(?)

Team Organization:
Meetings will be regularly on Thursdays and additional meetings may be held throughout the week if required.  
Team division on tasks will be chosen voluntarily following which the members will be asked to work on the next task, to balance the amount of work done by each member(tasks will be handled between 2-3 members depending on difficulty).

Tools:
Messenger or discord will be used for direct communication between members. Github will be used for sharing code and other important documents. We will use javascript, php, mysql, and html to develop our web based system.

Attended requirement meeting:
Mila, Dominic, Yushae, Nielson and Nanda.
